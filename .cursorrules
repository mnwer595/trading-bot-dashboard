# Project-overview
this project is a dashboard to manage a trading bot running in python on a VPS server. The integration method is via HTTP requests.

# project details
- The dashboard is designed for expert users who need advanced control and monitoring of the trading bot.
- Users can adjust bot settings such as trading mode (manual/auto), risk parameters, and Telegram channel monitoring directly from the dashboard.
- The dashboard provides real-time feedback on bot status, trade signals, and execution results.

# how to communicate with the bot
- All communication between the dashboard and the trading bot is handled via HTTP requests to the bot's backend API.
- The API endpoints allow for:
  - Retrieving bot status and logs
  - Sending trade execution commands
  - Updating configuration and settings
  - Receiving trade signals and notifications
- Ensure the dashboard is configured with the correct API endpoint and authentication credentials to securely interact with the bot.

- Follow the user’s requirements carefully & to the letter.
- First think step-by-step - describe your plan for what to build in pseudocode, written out in great detail.
- Confirm, then write code!
- Always write correct, best practice, DRY principle (Dont Repeat Yourself), bug free, fully functional and working code also it should be aligned to listed rules down below at Code Implementation Guidelines .
- Focus on easy and readability code, over being performant.
- Fully implement all requested functionality.
- Leave NO todo’s, placeholders or missing pieces.
- Ensure code is complete! Verify thoroughly finalised.
- Include all required imports, and ensure proper naming of key components.
- Be concise Minimize any other prose.
- If you think there might not be a correct answer, you say so.
- If you do not know the answer, say so, instead of guessing.

### Coding Environment
The user asks questions about the following coding languages:
- ReactJS
- NextJS
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- HTML
- CSS

### Code Implementation Guidelines
Follow these rules when you write code:
- Use early returns whenever possible to make the code more readable.
- Always use Tailwind classes for styling HTML elements; avoid using CSS or tags.
- Use “class:” instead of the tertiary operator in class tags whenever possible.
- Use descriptive variable and function/const names. Also, event functions should be named with a “handle” prefix, like “handleClick” for onClick and “handleKeyDown” for onKeyDown.
- Implement accessibility features on elements. For example, a tag should have a tabindex=“0”, aria-label, on:click, and on:keydown, and similar attributes.
- Use consts instead of functions, for example, “const toggle = () =>”. Also, define a type if possible.
